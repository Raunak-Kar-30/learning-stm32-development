// This program is not present in Mazidi book. This is a custom program to practice all the skills I have learnt till now.
// We want to be able to configure and use the on board RTC module provided by ST themselves.
// The only resources I have for this are the reference manual and the data sheet of my board.

// Includes
#include "stm32f4xx.h"

// Main
int main(void)

	return 0;
