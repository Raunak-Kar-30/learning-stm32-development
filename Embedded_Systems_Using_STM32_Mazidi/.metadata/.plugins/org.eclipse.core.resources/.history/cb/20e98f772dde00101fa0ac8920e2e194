	// Turn on the on-board temperature sensor connected to channel 18, we also need to disable VBAT since it is also connected to the same channel
	// - channel 18 as the temperature sensor, and when both Temp-sensor and VBAT are enabled, only the VBAT value will be read and converted.

	// Set the resolution for the ADC1

	// Set the sampling time appropriately (according to the resolution)

	// Set the temp sensor channel - channel 18 as the first in the sequence of ADC conversion (since we have no other conversions)

	// Set the ADC conversion to occur every EXTEN rising edge. Select the EXTSEL to Timer 2 channel 2

	// Enable the ADC1

	// Keep reading data from the temp-sensor, and print the data to USART2
	while(1)
	{
		// Wait until End of Conversion bit is set in Status Register

		// Read the data from the ADC1 Data Register

		// Convert the data read (which is expressed in terms of voltage) to readable temperature data.

		// Print the raw data value and temp value to the terminal via USART.
