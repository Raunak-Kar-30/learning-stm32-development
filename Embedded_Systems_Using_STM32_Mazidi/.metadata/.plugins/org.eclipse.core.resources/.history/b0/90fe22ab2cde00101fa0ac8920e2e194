	// Set the sampling time appropriately (according to the resolution)

	// Set the temp sensor channel - channel 18 as the first in the sequence of ADC conversion (since we have no other conversions)

	// Set the ADC conversion to occur every EXTEN rising edge. Select the EXTSEL to Timer 2 channel 2

		// Convert the data read (which is expressed in terms of voltage) to readable temperature data.

		// Print the raw data value and temp value to the terminal via USART.
