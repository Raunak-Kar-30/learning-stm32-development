// Function declarations (private)

// Setup the timer 2 for ADC conversion - provides the ADC with a timer for starting conversion
void timer2_setup_adc(int sys_freq)
{
	// Enable clock access to TIM2

	// Set the timer pre-scaler such that it provides a clock source of 1MHz = 1000000 Hz

	// Set the Auto Reload Register such that it counts to 1000000, to provide a timer signal every 1 second

	// Set the TIM2 Count Register (CNT) to 0

	// Enable channel 2 in Capture/Compare Enable register

	// The Capture Compare Register (1 or 2) is either used to store the value to be compared to the CNT register when the channel is setup in Output Compare
	// Mode, or it is used as a snapshot register that holds the value of the CNT register, the moment some input signal is captured when the channel
	// is setup in Input Capture Mode
}
